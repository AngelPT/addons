[RETEX] New MP Female Head Texture 0.8 BETA

RETEXTURE TUTORIAL
------------------

Now here's the tricky part

1. Create mod file using OPENIV (duplicate of the original GTA V files).
   This is to ensure updates won't remove your mods.

2. Extract and paste "head_033_r.ydd" and "head_040_r.ydd" into

   mods/update/x64/dlcpacks/mppatcheng/dlc.rpf/x64/models/cdimages/mppatches.rpf/mp_f_freemode_01

   and
   
   mods/update/x64/dlcpacks/patchday4ng/dlc.rpf/x64/models/cdimages/patchday4ng.rpf/mp_f_freemode_01

3. Extract and paste "head_diff_033_a_whi" and "head_diff_040_a_chi" ONLY into

   mods/update/x64/dlcpacks/mppatcheng/dlc.rpf/x64/models/cdimages/mppatches.rpf/mp_f_freemode_01
